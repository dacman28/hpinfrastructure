# HoneyPot Infrastructure
**There are two things to be careful of with this template**
1. This is done in AWS. It can cause significant charges if not monitored or not used properly.
2. This deploys with an instance accessible to the internet. Take care so that you do not put yourself at risk.

Use this template to create a new CloudFormation stack. 

Currently it deploys two SSM managed instances (Ubuntu and Linux). You can mess around with the parameters if you so desire. It is part of a larger project to develop a robust honeypot architecture in AWS.
